## Removed Debug Code
- Removed System.out.println debug statements
- Cleaned up exception handling to focus on essential information
- Removed unused imports and commented code

## Improved Code Organization
- Standardized error handling patterns
- Improved method documentation
- Ensure consistent code formatting

## Servlet Improvements
- Fixed servlet mapping conflicts in GlobalErrorServlet
- Streamlined request handling in BaseServlet
- Improved attribute handling for order management

## Enhanced Stability
